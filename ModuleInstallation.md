1. Open **Command Prompt** on your computer by opening the Start Menu, typing `cmd`, and pressing the Enter key. 

2. Confirm *Python* is installed correctly by typing `python` into the code line. If you see a message that says:
```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program, or batch file.
```
Python was installed incorrectly. This means the checkbox "Add Python 3.X to PATH" was not ticked during the initial Python installation. In that case, please skip to the section *"I did not install Python to the path"* below. If you see a message that says something like:
```
Python 2.7.10 (default, Aug 17 2018, 19:45:58) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.0 (clang-1000.0.42)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
You installed Python correctly.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to [www.pypy.org/project/pyserial](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial) and select the "Download files" tab under Navigation.

4. Click on "pyserial-3.4.tar.gz" to download.
