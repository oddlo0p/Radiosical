# How To Install pySerial and pygame
*If Python 3 is not already installed, please do so now at [python.org](https://www.python.org).*


***It is recommended you install the Stable version of the modules and not the Latest, as they are the easiest to manage with less issues/bugs.***

## pySerial
#### Windows

1. Open **Command Prompt** on your computer by opening the Start Menu, typing `cmd`, and pressing the Enter key.

2. Confirm *Python* is installed correctly by typing `python` into the code line. If you see a message that says:
```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program, or batch file.
```
Python was installed incorrectly. This means the checkbox "Add Python 3.X to PATH" was not ticked during the initial Python installation. In that case, please skip to the section *"I did not install Python to the path"* below. If you see a message that says something like:
```
Python 2.7.10 (default, Aug 17 2018, 19:45:58) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.0 (clang-1000.0.42)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
You installed Python correctly.
